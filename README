Cart5 is just a proof of concept to show one of the possibilities to change the user experience of a typical shopping cart using the features of HTML5.

You can read about HTML5 specs at

 

1)   Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)

2)   W3C

 

This shopping cart primarily focuses on the Drag ‘n Drop feature in HTML5. It shows how Drag ‘n Drop can be used to enhance the shopping experience on your site.

 

Some HTML5 features explored in this sample application are

1) Drag 'n Drop

2) Document/CSS Selectors

3) Local Storage

 

The other new technologies/trends used in this application are

1)      ASP.NET MVC 3 Preview 1

2)      Document Database using RavenDB

3)      Razor View Engine

Prerequisites for compiling and running the code on your machine

1)      Visual Studio 2010

2)      ASP.NET MVC 3 Preview 1

3)      RavenDB

 

 Getting started

1)      Install RavenDB

2)      Install ASP.NET MVC3 Preview 1

3)      You can import some product data into RavenDB from cart5.dump (attached in this post) file using RavenSmuggler utility e.g. > RavenSmuggler in http://localhost:8080 cart5.dump

Or you can start adding products by navigating to /Product/Create view in the application.

4)      Open the CartFive.sln in Visual Studio 2010 to compile and run the application.

I have tested it on Firefox 4 beta 5 and Chrome 6. I had tried it on IE 9 Preview 4 but, didnt work well.

I am not so good at creativity so you may find the UI very rudimentary.

some UI elements are taken from html5demos.com and jQuery Tools.
